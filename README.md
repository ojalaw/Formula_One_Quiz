## Design  

### Colour Scheme

Initial color scheme is general Dark theme with Black and Grey used for background colors white predominatly used for text and Red used as an accent colour. I have used this to give the site a modern contempary feel, the colour scheme is also similar to that of Formula One and has been used for symbolic purposes.

### Typography
This Formula One Quiz utilises One Google Font for Typography, Titillium Web has been used. This font has been chosen because it is the font that has been used by Formula One, this will give users an authentic feel to the quiz, especially users who are familiar with Formula One.

### Layout




### Symbology  
I have put alot of thought into the symbology of the site. For example, many of the design and animation aspects have been done to closely match what can be seen in Formula One today. As previously mentioned, the gogle font used is the same as in Formula One, the scoring system matches the way that racers are scored. The audio that features throughout the site is very similar to what would be heard during a race day. The starting light procedure proior to the quiz is what one would see prior to a race starting and the displayed score at the end mimics end of race celebrations.
