## Manual Testing  

During the manual testing, I tested the sites functionality, usability and responsiveness.  

#### Functionality

**Quiz Logic**

During the initial phase of implementing the quiz logic, I realised that multiple answers could be selected for each individual question. To correct this, i appropriately modified the ternary operator that i had already included so that only one answer could be selected at a time for each question. I also realised that i had not added a message at the end of the quiz to notify users that the quiz was finished.



**Usability**  


**Responsiveness**
